   # Workout Tracker

I wanted to make an app using Android Studio and Kotlin.

It is a simple app that can be used to list workouts via input from the user, track the workouts
completed, and it also has the option for the user to delete any workouts they do not wish to keep. 

I wanted to teach myself how to make an app that would be useful.

# Development Environment

* Android Studio 
* Kotlin



# Useful Websites

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

# Future Work


* In the future, I would like to improve the app by integrating a camera feature so people can keep 
track of physical progress and gains.
* I would also like to store data in local storage so the user can access it if the app is closed or
the phone is turned off.
